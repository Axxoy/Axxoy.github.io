## About Me

🙋🏻‍♂ Hey there, it's me, Cüneyt! I'm thrilled to have you on my blog. I'm a CS graduate who's always eager to learn, solve problems, indulge in gaming, and explore the tech world. My online adventures keep me absorbed — from my major's developments to the intricacies of game design. 🚀

📓🎓 I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in December 2023. In my spare time, I’m passionate about continuous learning, refining both technical expertise and interpersonal skills.

Right now, I'm immersing myself in:
- `web development`
- `C#`, `Java`
- `game design`
- dabbling in Photoshop and graphic design 🎨
