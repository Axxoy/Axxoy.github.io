<div style="text-align: justify;">
🙋🏻‍♂ Hey there, it's me, Cüneyt, and I'm thrilled to have you on my blog! I'm currently a senior CS student, always eager to learn, solve problems, indulge in gaming, and explore the tech world. My online adventures keep me absorbed, as I dive into various subjects, ranging from my major's developments to the intricacies of game design. 🚀

<br>
<br>

📓 I'm on the path to snagging a computer science bachelor's degree, with my eyes set on graduating in 2023. Whenever I find a moment, I delve into reading, soaking up new knowledge, and honing a mix of soft and technical skills.

<br>
<br>

Between juggling my degree and my myriad interests, I make a point to zoom in on a select few at any given time – ones that bring me utmost joy and satisfaction. Presently, that translates to immersing myself deeper into my field, brushing up on <code>web development</code>, flexing my skills in <code>C#</code> and <code>Java</code>, and wrapping my head around <code>game design</code> essentials. Oh, and you might've noticed a sprinkle of my dabbling in photoshop and graphic design here and there, too! 🎨

# This Site 

<!-- <div style="text-align: justify"> -->
I wanted to create a more `personal` and blog friendly website where I can really talk about myself, and share my thoughts. I also wanted to have a place where I can share my `projects`, `progress`, and of course, blog about whatever I find of `interest`. I do still intend on keeping my <a href="https://www.axoy.me"> other page </a>, but I will be using this one more often. Plus, this blog has a comment section at the bottom of posts, which I think is pretty cool 😅

You will find wide range of posts on here, from CS, to Linux, Bash, AI-concepts of interest, projects I am working on or completed, video games I find interesting, my own game development journey, and even non-technical content.


> __*As for the technical side of this website, I made it using a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme, and it is being hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I will create a post on how I did it all of that, but in the meantime you can check out [this great post](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) if you would like to get started yourself!*__

Al-Rowad International Schools 🎒
: 2006 - 2018
> Get ready to step into the halls of **Al-Rowad International Schools** 🏫, the canvas where my educational journey began in 2006 and went through 2018! 🎨 This was when I *first experienced* what it meant to be a student, to be curious, to learn, and to make friends. How does one fit **12 years** into a single page? I remember being away from home for the *first time*, those early school mornings that felt like a never-ending quest to locate my *missing socks*, and the thrill of those lunchtime escapades where the cafeteria was our *battlefield for swapping snacks and sharing laughter*.
>
> From whispering in hushed tones during *exams* to **cheering each other on during sports days**, every interaction was a brushstroke on the canvas of our shared experiences 🖼. The *annual school events* were like *mini festivals*, and let's not forget the nerves and excitement of *presenting projects in front of the class*. And yes, even those *group projects* that sometimes felt like *herding cats*, but somehow, we managed to *pull them off* – usually at the last minute! ⌛️
>
> Of course, they say school is never easy for students, but with all its *occasional sadness and challenges*, as I *reflect on those years*, I like to imagine my time there was filled with **blissful memories** that I still cherish to this day. 🌊
>
> 🎉 Graduating from there wasn't just a diploma; it was the *countless little victories*, *late-night study sessions*, and *inside jokes* that only we understood. From *scribbling my first letters* to **learning complex equations**, I *explored every part of what education offers*. Those years might have passed, but the memories remain as *vivid as ever*. So here's to **Al-Rowad International Schools**, where education was more than just lessons – it was a *journey that shaped who I am today*, filled with *colorful memories* and *friendships* that will forever hold a special place in my heart. 📚🌟

# Interests/Hobbies

![Gameboy](/assets/img/about-me/gameboy.png){: w="772" . .}
*Started out early XD*

Yep, that's me, mindlessly playing games while touching grass. Ironic I know. Games were my escape for as long as I can remember, playing on consoles like the `Game Boy Advance`, `Game Boy Advance SP`, `Nintendo DS`, `PSP`, `PS3`, `XBOX 360`, `XBOX One`, `PS4`, `Nintendo Switch`, I've had them all. 

I remember being really invested into single-player games for a while, because that's basically all I knew. Until, ofcourse, I was introduced to multiplayer games, starting with the original `MW2`. That was when I *REALLY* got into it, often shaving time off school and homework (sorry mom) to get a chance and 1v1 people in Rust. First-person shooter games started to become my forte. I would spend hours upon hours online searching up gameplay videos, tutorials, tips and news of upcoming *Call of Duty* & *Battlefield* titles. I like to think that I learned a great deal from those days, and made memories playing with friends, reaching out, and just having fun. And whenever I was away from my consoles, I would fire up a laptop lying around and try my hand at playing online Flash games, like the ones on [Y8](https://www.y8.com/tags/flash), strategy games, and farmer simulations like `Good Game Farmer` 🌾. Good times.. hehe. 🕹

That was when I really got into the youtube, streaming, and gaming world. I wanted to be a part of the excitement and possibilities they offered. Even though my YouTube channel didn't become a big thing and I didn't do a lot of streaming, the enthusiasm and passion I gained back then still guide how I enjoy gaming and being part of these communities today. Being in those spaces and circles definitely had a big impact on who I am today and how I still enjoy being a part of it. 🎮✨

> ### Some of my other pastimes:
>
>`Graphic Design/Photo Editing`: Mainly using Photoshop, I enjoy designing posters, flyers, retouching and adjusting images, and other designs. 
>
>`Recording random stuff`: Sometimes mini-vlogs that are reel-worthy, and moments in general to keep as memories.
>
>`Reading`: Philosophy, self-help books, fiction and more. Currently reading the [Third Circle Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Third-Circle-Theory-Purpose-Observation/dp/0985601337).
>
>`Journaling`: Helps set my mind straight and reflect.
>
>`Art`: Sketching & illustration.
>
>`Blogging`: Hence why this place exists..

<!-- > **Dream**: To be a gamer/streamer/youtuber -->

# MBTI

INFP... nuff said. But I try not to get too lost in personality types, they don't predict/reflect everything.

# Skills/Current Projects

As for what's keeping me busy these days, I'm in the final stretch of my bachelor's degree, working my way through the last semester at university. 🎓 My focus is on a capstone project that's a culmination of my academic journey – a significant milestone. I'm diving into software development lifecycles and using agile methods to ensure things run smoothly. 💻 Alongside that, I'm also fine-tuning my software development skills to keep up with the ever-evolving industry. 🚀 On a personal interest note, I'm quietly exploring game design principles, finding the sweet spot where technology and creativity meet. 🎮 This phase is a mix of academic dedication, technical growth, and a touch of artistic curiosity, as I approach the point where I'll complete my degree and embark on new adventures. 🌱
